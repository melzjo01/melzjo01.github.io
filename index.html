<p>Baseball has been a part of my life since i was 5. I started out playing teeball when I was first able to. I played throughout highschool into my freshman year of college. I ended up quitting baseball because I did not like any of the people I played with except for one kid. The kid that i enjoyed hanging out with during baseball decided he was going to quit. I gave it a week after he quit and hated it. So then I decided to quit as well.</p>
<h1>Ultimate Frisbee</h1>

<p>I did not join frisbee until after I quit baseball. I chose to play frisbee because I wanted to continue to be active in sports. I fell in love with playing frisbee. I will continue to play even after I leave luther.</p>
