<p>Baseball has been a part of my life since i was 5. I started out playing teeball when I was first able to. I played pitcher and catcher mostly until I blew out my shoulder my sophmore year.
I played and entire year with a hurt shoulder. I spent the offseason rehabbing the shoulder. When I came back I continued to pitch but stopped playing catcher and moved to the outfield.
After rehabbing my shoulder for the year, I was able to make the All-State team for Minnesota.
I continued to play throughout highschool into my freshman year of college. 
I ended up quitting baseball in the fall of my freshman year.</p>
<h1>Ultimate Frisbee</h1>

<p>I did not join frisbee until after I quit baseball. 
I chose to play frisbee because I wanted to continue to be active in sports. 
I fell in love with playing frisbee.
My freshman year I played with the B team at Luther. 
After my first year I moved up to playing on the LUFDA team. 
I will continue to play even after I leave luther.</p>
